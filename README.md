This is a repository for resources completed as part of the Johns Hopkins University Data Visualization and Dashboarding With R Specialization.

In this Specialization, learners developed and honed their skills using R
to produce data visualizations. Learners created a range of figures,
from simple figures like histograms and scatter plots to more complex
figures like alluvial diagrams and heat maps. Learners incorporated
these visualization into reproducible reports and data dashboards.
Learners completed a Capstone at the end of the Specialization to
apply their knowledge and skills in an individual data visualization
project.
